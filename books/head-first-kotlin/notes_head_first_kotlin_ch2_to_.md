## Notes

## Variable declaration

- When a variable is declared, the value assigned to the variable is used to create an object.
- The type of the object is used to infer the type of the variable, unless explicitly declared, and the variable is fixed to that type forever.
- Then, a reference to the object is stored in the variable.
- A variable declared as `var` can have this reference changed, but a variable declared as `val` will store the same reference forever.

## Types of integers

- Kotlin has 4 types of integers: Byte, Short, Int, Long.
